# Contracts (e-sign)

Zebri includes a minimal, legally-valid e-signature flow so MCs can send service agreements, have the couple sign them, and automatically spawn the deposit invoice — without leaving the CRM.

## Status lifecycle

```
draft ──send──▶ sent ──sign──▶ signed
                 │  ──decline──▶ declined
                 │  ──expiry──▶ expired
                 └──revoke──▶ draft (new version, new token)
```

- **draft** — content is editable; no public link.
- **sent** — content is locked (`locked_content_html` is the frozen, variable-substituted snapshot). Public link active.
- **signed** — immutable. Audit trail is populated (`signer_name`, `signer_ip`, `signer_user_agent`, `signed_at`). Deposit invoice auto-created if a quote is linked.
- **declined** — terminal; `declined_reason` optional.
- **expired** — flipped nightly by `expire_contracts()` cron.
- **revoked** — old link is dead; status resets to `draft`, `version` bumps.

## Content authoring

Contracts are authored with TipTap (StarterKit + Mention). Variables are inserted as Mention nodes and are substituted at **send time**:

| Token | Source |
|---|---|
| `{{couple_name}}` | `couples.name` |
| `{{couple_email}}` | `couples.email` |
| `{{event_date}}` | earliest `events.date` |
| `{{venue}}` | earliest `events.venue` |
| `{{total_amount}}` | linked quote total |
| `{{deposit_amount}}` | linked quote total × `default_deposit_percent` (default 25%) |
| `{{mc_business_name}}` | `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data.business_name` |
| `{{mc_signature_name}}` | `raw_user_meta_data.mc_signature_name` |
| `{{today}}` | date sent |

See `lib/contract-variables.ts` for the catalog and rendering helpers.

## Signing

- Public page: `/contract/[token]`
- Signer types full legal name + ticks "I agree" checkbox.
- Typed name is rendered in a cursive font as the signature (Australian Electronic Transactions Act 1999 allows typed-name signatures).
- Server route `/api/contract/sign` captures `x-forwarded-for` IP + `user-agent` before calling the `sign_contract()` RPC.
- Audit trail is shown on the public page after signing and stamped onto the PDF.

## MC countersignature

- Automatic. MC sets their typed `mc_signature_name` in Settings → Personal Info once.
- At send time, this name is snapshotted into `contracts.mc_signature_name` so later changes don't retroactively alter a signed document.

## Linked quote → deposit invoice

When a contract with a linked (accepted) quote is signed, `sign_contract()` inserts:
1. A new `invoices` row with `status='draft'`, `subtotal` and items copied from the quote, and `deposit_percent` from `raw_user_meta_data.default_deposit_percent` (fallback 25%).
2. A follow-up task: "Contract signed by X — review & send deposit invoice".

The invoice is created as a draft so the MC can review before sending.

## Reminders & expiry

- Day-3 + day-7 reminder emails, capped at 2 reminders total (`reminder_count` column).
- Nightly Vercel cron hits `/api/email/send-contract-reminders` + `/api/cron/expire-contracts` (auth via `CRON_SECRET`).

## Plan gating

Contracts are a **Pro-plan** feature. `lib/subscription.ts` exposes `hasContractsAccess(userMeta)`. The Couple Profile tab, `/payments` Contracts tab, and send endpoint all gate on it.
